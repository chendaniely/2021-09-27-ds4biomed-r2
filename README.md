# Data Science for the Biomedical Sciences

This is the repository for the [`ds4biomed`](https://ds4biomed.tech/) materials.

## Download files and data

You can download the files and data to follow along the materials by clicking the green "Code" button on the top.
Then you can click "Download ZIP" to download the files.

## Binder cloud environment

If you are having installation issues,
there is a Binder instance with all the packages and datasets setup that you can use
in a browser.
You can click one of the Binder badges to launch a programming environment for you in the cloud.

Note that these instances can take a very long time to start up and install everything, it can take anywhere from 1 minute to over 30 minutes depending
on how long the last time someone has used a binder instance.

One caveat with Binder is that each instance does not persist any data.
So if you are idle for too long, or close out of the tab,
all the work you did within Binder will be lost.

You will need to either copy/paste your work to a place on your computer,
or export the files out of Binder if you wish to have files saved.
